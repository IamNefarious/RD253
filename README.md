# RD253
Changes to the RD-253

I made a change to the RD-253/275 to better resemble real life variants and performance and want to know your oppinions and wether I should create a PR or not:

- The base 253 has a little better thust and the correct Fuel-to-Oxidizer ratio of 2.67:1 (~Former Mk2)

- Added the 253F variant, with improved thrust and ISP (~Former Mk4)

- Maybe adding the 254 config (vacuum optimized version for U-700)

- Fixed 275/M F-to-O ration to 2.67:1

- Improved TestFlight config

I also added the configs to th ecorrect RP-0 node.
